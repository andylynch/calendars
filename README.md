## School Calendars

I've put together a parent friendly link of  Gordonbrock term dates for 2021-22 to keep in your phone or online calendar.  

Just click the link below to add these dates to your diary*: 

ðŸ‘‰  **[Add to your calendarðŸ“†](school-holidays.ics)** ðŸ‘ˆ


This is a phone-friendly version of the school's letter home and the [official Lewisham calendar](https://lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/education/schools/term-dates/term-dates-21-22). Any issues / corrections let me know [here](https://github.com/andylynch/calendars/issues/new).

*Tip: if you choose 'add calendar' it will stay  up to date with any new inset dates too.
